# Sadness
Trying to begin a software development company with no experience , literally from rock bottom on all aspects. 
The company name is meant to be ironic because I want t make software that will improve the everyday lives of the user,
even if it's just through a smile or a glimpse of joy.Furthermore, a feeling of sadness no matter how significant or influential 
it may be, we all try to distract ourself it's suffocation, I want my software to not only distract but suppress sadness from 
our conscious for as long as possible. Be happy, DO MORE!
